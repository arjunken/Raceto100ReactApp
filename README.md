# Raceto100

A Dice Game for Kids. Very simple and enjoyable trivia game that is built completely out of Javascript and using [ChanceJS] (https://chancejs.com/index.html) for randomn number generation and [Tabulator] (https://tabulator.info/) for presenting scores in a nicely formatted table.

## Target Audience

This game was built for kids. But, generally anyone likes to play trivia games can try. It's a way to relieve your stress and have fun with your kids.

## How does it work?

Currently, this game can only be played on one device sharing controls with other players. It is best presented on laptops, tablets and desktop computers. In the future, I might introduce a better version to play the game remotely using another device.

### Shakuni - The Robot

If you have no one to play, the game presents a robot player called "Shakuni". Shakuni is a mythological character derived from the Hindu epic "Mahabharata", wherein, Shakuni is mastermind behind a dice game that leads Pandavas and Kauravas go for a epical war. In this game, the player Shakuni has been configured to play in three levels which is from naive to clever. You can choose your level and play with him.
